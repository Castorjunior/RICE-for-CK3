RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. It is a collection of themed flavor "packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs, but often cover lesser-known places and peoples. It is a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2.

Each RICE flavor pack adds new features to a region, culture, or religion, such as a few simple mechanics and decisions, a smattering of cultural flavor events, and other miscellany. The guiding philosophy of RICE is to keep a tight, focused scope that doesn’t change gameplay significantly, but adds more flavor across the world.

[B]At the moment, RICE is compatible with any mod[/B] as it is designed with compatibility in mind; wherever possible, I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, title history and culture changes are done via hidden events at game start. As this mod grows, there may be greater likelihood for incompatibility issues, so I may add in game rules to help with any potential compatibility conflicts (for instance, game rules that disable stuff like province ownership chnanges that could clash with map mods).

[B][U]RICE [I]WILL[/I] WORK ON EXISTING SAVES![/U][/B] (Though remember to make a backup copy of your save just in case.)

Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. And if you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!
