RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. The guiding philosophy of RICE is to keep a tight, focused scope that doesn’t change gameplay significantly, but adds more flavor across the world, especially for lesser-known places, peoples, and histories.

[B]At the moment, RICE is compatible with any mod[/B] as it is designed with compatibility in mind; wherever possible, I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of province history. The likelihood for incompatibility issues will grow as I add more features, so I may implement in game rules to help with any potential compatibility conflicts.

[B][U]RICE [I]WILL[/I] WORK ON EXISTING SAVES![/U][/B] (Remember to [B]make a backup copy of your save[/B] just in case, and do note that some features only appear on new games.)

[B]Feel free to use my work in your mods[/B] - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. And if you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

Each RICE flavor pack adds new features to a region, culture, or religion, that can range from new decisions to new buildings, dynasty legacies, and more. Each Flavor Pack also comes with new generic flavor events and music.

Below are all currently available flavor packs. Click on the links to see [B]Guides[/B] for each flavor pack, with info on new features, tips and tricks, and selected lists of academic sources I used for further reading:

[h1]Version 1.2.2 "Carolus Magnus"[/h1]

[I]I would rather commit my story [of Charlemagne's biography] to writing, and hand it down to posterity in partnership with others, so to speak, than to suffer the most glorious life of this most excellent king, the greatest of all the princes of his day, and his illustrious deeds, hard for men of later times to imitate, to be wrapped in the darkness of oblivion.

- Einhard (c. 775 - 840 CE), The Life of Charlemagne[/I]
