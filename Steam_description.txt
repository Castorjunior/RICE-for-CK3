RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. The guiding philosophy of RICE is to keep a tight, focused scope that doesn’t change gameplay significantly, but adds more flavor across the world, especially for lesser-known places, peoples, and histories.

[B][U]RICE IS IRONMAN COMPATIBLE BUT *NOT* ACHIEVEMENT COMPATIBLE. It works on existing saves, but some features will not appear on new saves.[/U][/B] (Also make a backup copy of your save just in case.)

[B]Feel free to use my work in your mods[/B] - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. If you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

[B]RICE is designed with compatibility in mind, and runs fine with most mods - for more info on compatibility for various mods, please see [url=https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com/compatches]this webpage[/url][/B]. I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of directly through province history.

Special content is also provided if you're running with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2243307127][B]The Fallen Eagle[/B][/url].

There are known soft compatibility issues with some mods (i.e. wacky balance or weird behavior, rather than CTDs). Compatches are available for:

[LIST]
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2553043828][B]Ethnicities and Portraits Expanded[/B][/url] (not required but ensures RICE uses new ethnicities).
[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2573060053][B]Unique Building Plus[/B][/url]
[/LIST]

[B]I WILL NOT maintain compatches for most mods that may need one[/B]. Feel free to make your own if you want (let me know so I can link it here). If you're a modder, don't hesitate to contact me on the forums or Discord about compatibility!

Each RICE flavor pack adds features to a region, culture, or religion, that can range from new decisions to new buildings, dynasty legacies, and more, as well as generic flavor events and music. Please see the [url=https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com/flavor-pack-guides][B]Flavor Pack Guides[/B][/url] for more info on new features, tips and tricks, and selected lists of academic sources I used for further reading.
