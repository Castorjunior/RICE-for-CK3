RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. The guiding philosophy of RICE is to keep a tight, focused scope that doesn’t change gameplay significantly, but adds more flavor across the world, especially for lesser-known places, peoples, and histories.

[B][U]RICE IS IRONMAN COMPATIBLE BUT *NOT* ACHIEVEMENT COMPATIBLE. It works on existing saves, but some features will not appear on new saves.[/U][/B] (Also make a backup copy of your save just in case.)

[B]Feel free to use my work in your mods[/B] - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. If you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

[B]RICE is designed with compatibility win mind, and runs okay with most mods - for more info on compatibility for various mods, please see [url=https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com/compatches]this webpage[/url][/B]. I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of directly through province history.

There are known soft compatibility issues with some mods (i.e. wacky balance or weird behavior, rather than CTDs), and compatches are available for:

[B]I WILL NOT maintain compatches for most mods that may need one[/B]. Feel free to make your own if you want (let me know so I can link it here). If you're a modder, don't hesitate to contact me on the forums or Discord about compatibility!

Each RICE flavor pack adds features to a region, culture, or religion, that can range from new decisions to new buildings, dynasty legacies, and more, as well as generic flavor events and music. Please see the [url=https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com/flavor-pack-guides][B]Flavor Pack Guides[/B][/url] for more info on new features, tips and tricks, and selected lists of academic sources I used for further reading.

[h1]Translations[/h1]
RICE can be run safely in any language, just be aware if it's not translated, the mod uses the normal English text as a placeholder so you won't see gibberish.
[LIST]
[*]Chinese - a team led by Jujiote has translated much of the mod
[*]French - several translators including Mouchi have translated parts of the mod

[h1]Version 1.4.6 "Dhow"[/h1]

[I]The Dhow is a type of sailing vessel traditionally used throughout the Indian Ocean by many peoples, such as the Arabs, Persians, Swahili, Sindhi, and more. Over the centuries, thousands of sailors, merchants, pilgrims, slaves, adventurers, and more traveled the so-called maritime Silk Road in these dependable ships.[/I]

[LIST]
[*]Added two new faiths (that only appear with random character spawn from the Socotra Flavor Pack): Fomba Gasy (Malagasy), and Mwarism (Shona)
[*]Added decision to Restore the Necropolis of El-Bagawat for Christian rulers of Kharga
[*]Added a secret, optional decision to renovate Shri Badat’s palace instead of razing it, at the cost of losing the ability for anyone to celebrate Tumshiling forever (only available to characters who meet certain trait requirements)
[*]Added historical context tooltips to give brief overviews of the histories of Thabit ibn-Qurra, ibn Nabhan, the Banijurids, Azur Jamshid, Zunbils, and the various counts of Badakhshan in 867
[*]Assyrian and Mizrahi cultures now start the game with the Qanat innovation
[*]Iberian culture group and Sicilian and Sephardi cultures can now discover the Qanat innovation (but do not start the game with it)
[*]Runaway slave courtiers spawned in the Indian Ocean now sometimes have an appropriate religion matching their culture, rather than the potential employer’s religion
[*]Darkened icons for most pagan faiths in RICE to be more consistent with vanilla icons
[*]Increased chances AI will take the decision to Raze Shri Badat’s palace
[*]Miscellaneous bugfxies as usual
