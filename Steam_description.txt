RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. The guiding philosophy of RICE is to keep a tight, focused scope that doesn’t change gameplay significantly, but adds more flavor across the world, especially for lesser-known places, peoples, and histories.

[B][U]RICE [I]WILL[/I] WORK ON EXISTING SAVES![/U][/B] (Remember to [B]make a backup copy of your save[/B] just in case, and do note that some features only appear on new games.)

[B]Feel free to use my work in your mods[/B] - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. And if you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

[B]RICE is designed with compatibility win mind, and technically compatible with most mods[/B]; I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of directly through province history.

There are known soft compatibility issues with some mods (i.e. wacky balance or weird behavior, rather than CTDs). Some have compatibility patches or ones that are WIP:

[LIST]
[*] Dharmacakra - mod author is working on adding in-built compatibility
[*] Ethnicities and Portraits Expanded - [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2553043828]Compatch[/url] (not required per se, but ensures RICE uses new ethnicities)
[*] Sinews of War - Compatch is WIP
[/LIST]

As mentioned above, RICE should be compatible with most mods so other major content mods should be fine. Feel free to provide me details if you encounter issues.

[B]I WILL NOT maintain compatches for most mods that may need one[/B], especially those I have no interest in playing as it takes time and effort to test and maintain time. Anyone is free to make their own compatch if they want (I wouldn't mind a heads up, though, so I can link it here). If you are a mod author or user and concerned about compatibiliy with RICE, don't hesitate to contact me on the forums or Discord!

Each RICE flavor pack adds new features to a region, culture, or religion, that can range from new decisions to new buildings, dynasty legacies, and more. Each Flavor Pack also comes with new generic flavor events and music.

Below are all currently available flavor packs. Click on the links to see [B]Guides[/B] for each flavor pack, with info on new features, tips and tricks, and selected lists of academic sources I used for further reading:

[h1]Translations[/h1]
RICE can be run safely in any language, just be aware if it's not translated, the mod will use the normal English text as a placeholder.
[LIST]
[*]Chinese - a team led by Jujiote has translated most of the mod
[*]French - several translators including Mouchi have translated parts of the mod

[h1]Version 1.4.0 "Badakhshan"[/h1]

[I]Good deeds stand tall like a green pine, evil deeds bloom like flowers;
The pine is not as brilliant as the flowers, it seems.
When the frost comes, the pine will still stand tall,
While the flowers, withered, can be seen no more

- Nasir Khusraw

[LIST]

[*]Mahayana Buddhists can now take concubines (change done via hidden event to prevent compatibility issues with mods that modify Buddhist religions)
[*]There is now a few days wait when you take the decision to visit the Thermal Spas of Aachen, so it isn’t instantaneous

[*]Zahra the Poet now gets the Devoted (Nun) trait, as a wonky workaround to prevent players from potentially converting her to a non-Muslim religion or marrying her
