RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. The guiding philosophy of RICE is to keep a tight, focused scope that doesn’t change gameplay significantly, but adds more flavor across the world, especially for lesser-known places, peoples, and histories.

[B][U]RICE [I]WILL[/I] WORK ON EXISTING SAVES![/U][/B] (Remember to [B]make a backup copy of your save[/B] just in case.)

[B]Feel free to use my work in your mods[/B] - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. If you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

[B]RICE is designed with compatibility win mind, and is technically compatible with most mods[/B]; I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of directly through province history.

There are known soft compatibility issues with some mods (i.e. wacky balance or weird behavior, rather than CTDs). Some have compatibility patches:

[LIST]
[*] Ethnicities and Portraits Expanded - [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2553043828]Compatch[/url] (not required but ensures RICE uses new ethnicities)
[*] Sinews of War - WIP
[/LIST]

[B]I WILL NOT maintain compatches for most mods that may need one[/B]. Feel free to make your own compatch if you want (I wouldn't mind a heads up, though, so I can link it here). If you are a modder concerned about compatibiliy with RICE, don't hesitate to contact me on the forums or Discord!

Each RICE flavor pack adds new features to a region, culture, or religion, that can range from new decisions to new buildings, dynasty legacies, and more. Each Flavor Pack also comes with new generic flavor events and music.

Below are all currently available flavor packs. Click on the links to see [B]Guides[/B] for each flavor pack, with info on new features, tips and tricks, and selected lists of academic sources I used for further reading:
