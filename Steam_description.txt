RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. The guiding philosophy of RICE is to keep a tight, focused scope that doesn’t change gameplay significantly, but adds more flavor across the world, especially for lesser-known places, peoples, and histories.

[B]At the moment, RICE is compatible with any mod[/B] as it is designed with compatibility in mind; wherever possible, I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of province history. The likelihood for incompatibility issues will grow as I add more features, so I may implement in game rules to help with any potential compatibility conflicts.

[B][U]RICE [I]WILL[/I] WORK ON EXISTING SAVES![/U][/B] (Remember to [B]make a backup copy of your save[/B] just in case, and do note that some features only appear on new games.)

[B]Feel free to use my work in your mods[/B] - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. And if you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

Each RICE flavor pack adds new features to a region, culture, or religion, that can range from new decisions to new buildings, dynasty legacies, and more. Each Flavor Pack also comes with new generic flavor events and music.

Below are all currently available flavor packs. Click on the links to see [B]Guides[/B] for each flavor pack, with info on new features, tips and tricks, and selected lists of academic sources I used for further reading:

[h1]Version 1.2.3 "Thabit ibn Qurra"[/h1]

[I]We are the heirs and the transmitters to our heirs of paganism, which is honored gloriously in this world. [...] Who has made the world to be inhabited and filled it with cities except the good men and kings of paganism? Who has constructed harbors and canals? Who has made manifest the occult sciences? On whom has dawned the divinity which gives divination and teaches the knowledge of future events except the wise men of the pagans? [Pagans] have made to arise the medicine of souls, and have made to shine forth their redemption; have filled the world with the correctness of modes of life and with the and it is they also who have made to arise the medicine for bodies and the wisdom which is the beginning of excellence. Without these products of paganism the world would be an empty and a needy place, and it would have been enveloped in sheer want and misery.

- Thabit ibn Qurra (836-901 CE), as quoted by Bar Hebraeus, a 13th century Syriac Orthodox bishop and saint[/I]
