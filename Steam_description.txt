RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. The guiding philosophy of RICE is to keep a tight, focused scope that doesn’t change gameplay significantly, but adds more flavor across the world, especially for lesser-known places, peoples, and histories.

[B][U]RICE IS IRONMAN COMPATIBLE BUT *NOT* ACHIEVEMENT COMPATIBLE. It works on existing saves, but some features will not appear on new saves.[/U][/B] (Also make a backup copy of your save just in case.)

[B]Feel free to use my work in your mods[/B] - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up. If you liked the mod, feel free to favorite and rate it up!

[B]RICE is designed with compatibility win mind, and runs okay with most mods[/B]; I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, new cultures are added via hidden events at game start instead of directly through province history.

There are known soft compatibility issues with some mods (i.e. wacky balance or weird behavior, rather than CTDs). For more info on compatibility for various mods, please see [url=https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com/compatches][B]this webpage[/B][/url]. Compatches are available for:

[*][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2553043828][B]Ethnicities and Portraits Expanded[/B][/url] (not required but ensures RICE uses new ethnicities). 
[/LIST]

[B]I WILL NOT maintain compatches for most mods that may need one[/B]. Feel free to make your own if you want (let me know so I can link it here). If you're a modder, don't hesitate to contact me on the forums or Discord about compatibility!

Each RICE flavor pack adds features to a region, culture, or religion, that can range from new decisions to new buildings, dynasty legacies, and more, as well as generic flavor events and music. Please see the [url=https://cybrxkhansmods.godaddysites.com/flavor-pack-guides][B]Flavor Pack Guides[/B][/url] for more info on new features, tips and tricks, and selected lists of academic sources I used for further reading.

RICE can be run safely in any language, just be aware if it's not translated, the mod uses the normal English text as a placeholder so you'll at least won't see gibberish.
[LIST]
[*]Chinese - a team led by Jujiote has translated much of the mod
[*]French - several translators including Mouchi have translated parts of the mod

[h1]Version 1.4.4 "Amazigh"[/h1]

[I]Though ‘Berber’ is commonly used to describe the indigenous inhabitants of the Maghreb, even in scholarly literature, the term ‘Amazigh’ is the appellation they often used to describe themselves. They speak a branch of the Afro-Asiatic languages and historically have spread across all of North Africa, from the Guanches of the Canary Islands to the native inhabitants of Siwa Oasis in Egypt.[/I]

[LIST]
[*]Added Sus Flavor Pack: Door of the Sahara
[*]Added Guanche Flavor Pack: Edge of the World
[*]Added 5 new Middle Eastern themed music tracks
[*]Added a very minor county modifier to Myra, “Land of St. Nicholas” as a Christmas easter egg
[*]Added French translation to some of the Chios and Yorkshire Flavor Packs
[*]Tweaked Zunbil situation in 867 to be somewhat more historically accurate - there are now two playable Zunbil cousins, one Muslim and one Zunist, with a startup event explaining their situation (thanks to Tundragrass on Discord for pointing this out)
[*]Sufri is now male-dominated instead of gender equal
[*]Added global variable to detect RICE (for Stik)
[*]Split RICE landed titles into separate files per flavor pack
[*]Fixed missing icons for Stamford Bull Run and Pilgrimage to Beverley activities/decisions
[*]Fixed it being impossible to upgrade the Dragon Blood Forest duchy building in Socotra
[*]Fixed the Kingdoms of Socotra and Tuyuhun not having the “Kingdom of” prefix
[*]Fixed Zunbils and Azur Jamshid having clan government (hopefully for real this time)
[*]Miscellaneous bugfixes
