# Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment (a CK3 Mod)

## Latest Version: Version 1.1.0 "Reindeer" (Released 12/28/20)

RICE is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. It is a collection of themed flavor "packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs, but often cover lesser-known places and peoples. It is a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2.

Each RICE flavor pack adds new features to a region, culture, or religion, such as a few simple mechanics and decisions, a smattering of cultural flavor events, and other miscellany. The guiding philosophy of RICE is to keep a tight, focused scope that doesnâ€™t change gameplay significantly, but adds more flavor across the world.

RICE will be designed with compatibility in mind; wherever possible, I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, title history and culture changes are done via hidden events at game start. As this mod grows, I may add in game rules to help with potential compatibility conflicts (for instance, game rules that disable features that could clash with map mods).

Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.

## Manual Installation Steps

DO NOT manually download the master branch unless you know what you're doing as it is the WIP version that is constantly being updated!

1. Go to https://github.com/cybrxkhan/RICE-for-CK3/releases and find the latest version you wish to download.
2. Extract the .zip file to Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod
3. Launch CKIII and select RICE in the launcher.
4. Enjoy and play!

NOTE: If you are re-installing a mod, delete the old version of the mod first before copy and pasting the new one! While it's not always necessary, it's a good habit to do to prevent any potential issues.
