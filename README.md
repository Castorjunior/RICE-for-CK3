# Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment (a CK3 Flavor Mod)

## Latest Version: Version 1.3.1 "Suakin" (Released 7/20/21)

**Newest Flavor Pack - Red Sea: Treasures of the Eastern Desert**

_“We took ship at Suakin for Yemen. No sailing is done on this sea at night because of the number of rocks in it. At nightfall they land and embark again at sunrise. The captain of the ship stands constantly at the prow to warn the steersman of rocks.”_
_- Ibn Battuta, writing about his journey across the Red Sea_

RICE, or Regional Immersion and Cultural Enrichment, is a mod that adds immersion to different regions, cultures, and religions in CK3. As a spiritual successor to my Immersion Packs for CK2, it is a collection of "flavor packs" similar to PI's official flavor pack DLCs. The guiding philosophy of RICE is to keep a tight, focused scope that doesn’t change gameplay significantly, but adds more flavor across the world, especially for lesser-known places, peoples, and histories.

RICE will be designed with compatibility in mind; wherever possible, I avoid editing vanilla files to prevent conflicts with other mods. For example, title history and culture changes are done via hidden events at game start. As this mod grows, I may add in game rules to help with potential compatibility conflicts (for instance, game rules that disable features that could clash with map mods).

Feel free to use my work in your mods - all I ask is that I am credited and (if possible) to give me a heads up.

1. Go to https://github.com/cybrxkhan/RICE-for-CK3/releases and find the latest version you wish to download.

NOTE: If you are re-installing a mod amnually, delete the old version of the mod first before copy and pasting the new one! While it's not always necessary, it's a good habit to do to prevent any potential issues.
