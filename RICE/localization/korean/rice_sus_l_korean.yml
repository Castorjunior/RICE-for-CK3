 game_concept_sijilmasa_prosperity_desc:0 "The [County|E] of Sijilmasa always has a [county_modifier|E], called $game_concept_sijilmasa_prosperity$, that represents its economic and political influence as one of the most important trade centers in the Western Maghreb.\n\nThere are four levels to this modifier, and in order to increase the modifier's level, you'll need to take various [decisions|E] to improve Sijilmasa, especially if you are playing from the 867 bookmark. These decisions require you to #V Resolve Conflicts in Sijilmasa#!, #V Establish the Mints of Sijilmasa#!, and #V Divert and Dam the Ziz River#!. Besides increasing $game_concept_sijilmasa_prosperity$, these decisions provide  various benefits as well."

You can choose to make use of their connections, which grants you a [character_modifier|E] boosting your [income|E] as well as granting other bonuses, depending on which cultural or ethnic group they come from (either Berber, Arab, West African, or Jewish). You can get these bonuses even if you do not invite them into your court.\n\nThe #V Trans-Saharan Trade#! dynasty track has a couple [dynasty_perks|E] that improve this mechanic. The first one in the track, #V Ships of the Desert#!, increases the chances these events trigger. The third, #V Gold and Salt#!, unlocks a [decision|E], #V Network with Trans-Saharan Merchants#!, which increases the chances of these events triggering even more for a short duration of time, while providing other economic bonuses."
