 game_concept_nile_flood_desc:0 "The flooding of the Nile has been a crucial part of life in Egypt since the days of the pharaohs. Every year, the Nile will flood a certain amount, and [counties|E] along [GetGeographicalRegion('RICE_nile_river_valley').GetName] will get a [county_modifier|E] depending on the result. Most of the time, the flood will be normal, and there will be no in-game effect. If the flood is better than usual, the [county_modifiers|E] will give various benefits; if the flood is poor, or the Nile overfloods, then the [county_modifiers|E] will give various maluses.\n\nIf your [culture|E] has the #Bold $tradition_RICE_children_of_the_nile_name$#!

 # Modifiers

 RICE_nile_overflooding_flood_desc:0 "The waters of the Nile rose to nineteen cubits or more, a dangerously high result that will likely drown agricultural land and ruin the harvest in Egypt this year."
 RICE_nile_low_flood:0 "[nile_flood|E]: Low"
 RICE_nile_low_flood_desc:0 "The waters of the Nile rose to fourteen or fifteen cubits, a below average result that means the harvest will be meager in Egypt this year."

They had considerable political, economic, and religious importance in Pharaonic, Roman, and Medieval periods as they ensured authorities could promptly react to a good or bad flood. Following the Arabic conquest, the nilometer on Rawda Island, in Cairo, became the most important in Egypt. It was managed by a hereditary official called the Ibn Abi’l-Raddad, who would report daily to the Sultan during the flooding season."

Eventually, like elsewhere in Egypt, they were abandoned and afterwards the structures were reused for other purposes or for building materials."
 RICE_upper_egypt_temple_of_philae_context_tooltip:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! In the late Pharaonic and Greco-Roman periods of Egyptian history, the temple on the island of Philae near Aswan became a cult center for Isis, who was worshipped by both Egyptians and the neighboring Nubians and Blemmyes. The last known hieroglyphic inscription in history was carved in 394 CE in the temple of Philae by Nesmeterakhem, a priest of Isis. Graffiti in Demotic script (a vernacular, cursive descendant of hieroglyphics) by priests of Isis is also attested as late as 451/452 CE."
 RICE_upper_egypt_temple_of_elephantine_context_tooltip:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! The island of Elephantine was an important Egyptian cult center, as it was considered the home of Khnum, god of pottery, the Nile, and the guardian of its source. Elephantine hosted a number of temples dedicated to the so-called Elephantine Triad, which consisted of 1) Khnum himself; 2) his consort Satet, a goddess of war, hunting, and the Nile flood; and 3) Anuket, the Nile itself and a lust goddess who was either Khnum and Satet's daughter, Satet's sister, and/or a junior consort of Khnum. Elephantine was already in decline by the Roman period, as it was overshadowed in importance by the Temple at Philae."

Several other deities were also present at the temple. Later, when Nubia was Christianized, the temple was reused as a church for some time. Interestingly, the temple was never formally completed."
