Though Ya‘qub‘s attack has traditionally been interpreted as a sign of his power-hungry, even irreligious nature, it is possible that he, as a holy warrior, may have seen Al-Mu‘tamid as unworthy and sought to replace him with a more deserving Abbasid.\n\nYa‘qub passed away in 879 and while his status as a proto-nationalist is perhaps a touch exaggerated, there is no doubt that his career marked the early stages of the disintegration of Abbasid authority in Iran, and the rise of various Iranian potentates."

 yazd.0007.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Faramurz was last mentioned in the historical records in 1063 CE, so he likely died sometime after that. By then, he and his heirs  had established themselves as loyal and respected vassals of the Seljuks, despite their initial tempestuous start. For example, Faramurz’s son and successor, Ali, married Arslan Khatun, Alp Arslan's sister.\n\nThe later Kakuyids were content to rule Yazd, transforming it into a cultural center. The last known ruler of the dynasty was a certain Garshasp, Faramurz’s grandson, who reportedly died in 1141 CE at the Battle of Qarwan, when the Kara-Khitan (or Western Liao) resoundingly defeated the Seljuks.\n\nYazd was then given to Garshasp’s son-in-law, a Turkish commander named Sam ibn Wardanruz, who established the dynasty of the Atabegs of Yazd. As the continuation of the Kakuyids, they lasted into the 14th century under the Ilkhanate."
