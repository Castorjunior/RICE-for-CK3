I then ritually shake this flour onto the pillars of my house and tie what remains of the barley to the pillar of the #italic chikish#!, or the kitchen.\n\nAfterwards, I and my entire household gather around a bowl, the eponymous #italic chinir#! itself, which is filled with yogurt. We bow our heads, and say [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] prayers to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]. Following this, everyone eats a bit of the yogurt."

 pamir.0053.t:0 "The Great Feast"
 pamir.0053.desc:0 "The next part of the Chinir is a big gathering among those of my gender. As a [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan], I meet with several others of the same gender from the community - ranging from prominent nobles to the lowliest of peasants - inside a large meeting hall to partake in a great feast."

 pamir.0055.desc:0 "At the end of the Chinir Festival, it is customary to symbolically assist in the harvesting of crops, even if one isn’t a farmer. After all, it is important that everyone shows their bonds with the community, even I, a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], should partake in this. It isn’t like I am doing real farmwork, anyways."
 pamir.0055.a:0 "I am no toiling peasant! I won’t do anything."

 pamir.0056.desc:0 "During the first batch of harvesting done at the Chinir Festival, everyone - even children - participates in the cutting of the grain crops, but there are clear roles to be observed. Men use small scythes called #italic thutr#! to cut the grain, while women tie the grain stalks into bundles ready for threshing. I’ll spend a couple hours doing this, before returning to the festivities."

Because of this, he was revered by both Shiite and Sunni Muslims alike.\n\nAs [nasir_khusraw.GetFullName] lived as a hermit not too far from the hamlet of Yamgan in [badakhshan_county.GetNameNoTier] for much of his later life, his followers have brought his body there to be buried. They are erecting a small shrine in his honor, and word has already spread far and wide about pilgrims who wish to travel to Yamgan to pay their respects to this beloved holy man."

In particular, though I consider myself an educated person, I have difficulty reconciling the issues between religion and classical philosophy that the poem discusses.\n\nI decide to approach [nasir_khusraw.GetFullName] about this matter, for everyone knows he is full of wisdom and brilliant insight. In fact, I told him that I was willing to commission him to write a response to Al-Jurjani’s poem. To my relief, he said he was willing to do such a thing."

In truth, I am not headed to Yamgan itself, but rather to a shrine near it - the shrine that houses the tomb of the famed [nasir_khusraw.GetFullName], the great poet, scholar, and holy man. In Badakhshan and many parts of around the Pamirs, though he was a proselytizer of the Ismaili sect in his lifetime, he is still revered by both Shiite and Sunni Muslims in the region.

It is a small shrine, to say the least, the size of a modest house at best, yet I feel this somehow fits Nasir Khusraw perfectly - here rests no wealthy and decadent debauchee, but a humble, benevolent servant of Allah.\n\nIt is getting late, however, so I need to rest first; I’ll enter the shrine tomorrow. With that in mind, I make my way up the dirt path to another building, a pilgrim’s lodge which is next to a soup kitchen. There, I shall be no different than any of the other visitors, and my rank, status, wealth, and even the sect of Islam I follow means nothing, for Muslims of all sects have long paid their respects to Nasir Khusraw."
 pamir.0132.a:0 "We are all equal in the eyes of Allah."
 pamir.0133.t:0 "Entering the Shrine"
 pamir.0133.desc:0 "Morning is upon us. Today, I enter Nasir Khusraw’s shrine. First, though, I circumambulate around the shrine many times, saying various prayers.\n\nOnce done, I come inside, and see that there are several rooms, all just as humble-looking as the outside walls. I have heard from some that this building was, supposedly, where Nasir Khusraw lived for many years, writing poetry and such. I also notice there are many cuts and smudges on the wall, evidence of writings that devout pilgrims have scrawled on here over the years.\n\nI finally enter the room which has Nasir Khusraw’s tomb. Once again, it is relatively humble in appearance, yet this strangely fills me with more inspiration and joy. There are only a few other pilgrims here inside, and they mostly ignore me as they pray."

 pamir.0134.t:0 "Prayer"
 pamir.0134.desc:0 "Before I begin praying, I look around the room again, taking in the experience. Though its appearance is humble, that does not mean it is unpleasant or bland; it is still nicely decorated, and I spot several holy objects. There is an incense burner and lamp on the shrine, for example, and more prominently, a copy of the Quran said to have been written by Nasir Khusraw himself.\n\nI refocus and remind myself I have not come here to admire the architecture, but to worship Allah and reflect on the holy life and deeds of Nasir Khusraw. I close my eyes for a moment, before I begin saying prayers."
 pamir.0134.a:0 "Praise be to Allah, the most merciful, the most benevolent…."
 pamir.0135.t:0 "Leaving a Mark"
 pamir.0135.desc:0 "Before I leave the shrine, there is one last thing I can do. It is custom here for pilgrims like me to leave behind some writing on the walls. Some deride this as graffiti of a sacred place, but many see it as a way to commemorate their visit, honor Allah and Nasir Khusraw, and, in a way, seek out one last blessing. Over the years, there have been several typical kinds of writings scrawled on the wall. If I wish to write anything on these walls, now would be the time, so I quietly make my way over to a corner of the building I find appealing, and prepare to write…."
 pamir.0135.a:0 "A copy of one of the beautiful poems Nasir Khusraw wrote."

As a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], perhaps I should take this opportunity to provide charity before I depart from here."

 pamir.0150.t:0 "Organizing for Chawmos"
 pamir.0150.desc:0 "The winter solstice is nearly upon us, which means it is almost time to celebrate the Chawmos Festival. As a devotee of the gods, in the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] manner, it is important for me to participate in this event, for it is a sacred time of year, when we perform the necessary rituals to guide this year into the next, and to proper delineate that which is pure and that which is impure.\n\nI and other community leaders will gather the people of the nearby towns, and together, we will work hard to prepare a grand Chawmos for this year. Ultimately, despite the fun that we may and will have, we must take all of this seriously, and do our best to ensure the event is a spiritual success."
 pamir.0150.a:0 "Let’s get to work."
 pamir.0151.t:0 "Bandek"
 pamir.0151.desc:0 "Preparations for this year’s Chawmos are underway, but as is custom, I and several other prominent locals need to partake in the #italic Bandek#! ritual. Inevitably, people pass away during the course of the year, and the #italic Bandek#! is the opportunity for us to ritually invite relatives of the deceased to end their period of mourning, and rejoin the community. I will need to spend some time going door to door to some of these locals’ houses, and formally requesting them to join Chawmos."
 pamir.0151.a:0 "Let’s go without delay! Doing this is integral to the Chawmos’ success."
 pamir.0151.b:0 "I don’t need to greet peasants - other local leaders can go in my stead."
 pamir.0152.t:0 "Sarazari"
 pamir.0152.desc:0 "Chawmos officially begins with the #italic Sarazari#! ritual, which revolves around juniper, the sacred plant used in many of our purification rituals. I, as well as other nobles, villagers, travelers, and [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')], and others have gathered at a designated location to witness the #italic Sarazari#!. During this ritual, young boys and girls separate into two groups based on gender, and light the juniper branches in a competition to see who can create the most amount of smoke, all of which is dedicated to the god Balumain."
 pamir.0152.desc.boy:0 "\n\nThis year, it seems the boys have won, as the smoke they made is clearly more so than the girls’! After #italic Sarazari#! Is done, the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] hold juniper branches and offer prayers. Once done, the final part of #italic Sarazari#!, where children excitedly run through the village with walnuts, and knock on each house’s door with these walnuts, to pray for everyone’s well-being."

 pamir.0152.a:0 "Very good!"
 pamir.0153.t:0 "Kuta'mru"
 pamir.0153.desc:0 "Today is #italic Kuta’mru#!, an important day when the realms of the wilderness and civilization are most spiritually connected.\n\nIn the morning, children gather around the local temple for the #italic Chutayak#! ritual, where they paint the temple’s walls, doors, and columns with images of mountains, stars, various animals, and more. This is all done in complete silence.\n\nIn the afternoon, everyone focuses on making sculptures out of flour. These will be baked and displayed out in the pastures early next morning to symbolize their migration to the fields to graze, before they are sold to non-believers as we are not allowed to eat them. Typically, the sculptures depict shepherds or various animals; what shall I focus on sculpting this year?"
 pamir.0153.a:0 "Noble sheepdogs who guard our livestock."
 pamir.0153.b:0 "Wild stags who dwell in the rugged terrain."
 pamir.0153.c:0 "Cows who provide us with food, milk, and hide."
 pamir.0153.d:0 "Our humble and hard-working shepherds."
 pamir.0153.e:0 "Goats, for they are our most sacred animal."
 pamir.0154.t:0 "Madahik"
 pamir.0154.desc:0 "The next ritual in the Chawmos cycle is #italic Madahik#!, the day when we commemorate our dead ancestors. Outside the temple, we prepare a miniature wooden fortress called the #italic Chilikotik#!, where we place many items of food. After this tower of food is lit, we all hurry into the temple, to allow the ancestors time and space to visit. Inside the temple, an elder calls out, “Oh elders, come eat and drink, then leave.”\n\nOnce enough time has passed, we emerge from the temple. Outside, the #italic Chilikotik#! and all the food is completely burnt into ashes."
 pamir.0154.a:0 "Surely, the ancestors were satisfied this year."
 pamir.0155.t:0 "Sawelik Hari"
 pamir.0155.desc:0 "It is time for the ritual of #italic Sawelik Hari#!, where we are expected to be rid of useless old possessions, and replace them with new ones. More entertainingly, it is time for a theatrical performance that satirizes the recent events of the previous year. Everyone roars with laughter as various community members are made fun of (all in good humor, of course). Earlier, when we were organizing the Chawmos festival, what did we agree on would be the theme of this year’s performance?"
 pamir.0155.a:0 "Various deeds (or misdeeds) I have accomplished"
 pamir.0155.b:0 "The trivial things that happen in the local villagers’ lives"
 pamir.0155.c:0 "News of grand events that occurred far away"
 pamir.0156.t:0 "Goshnik"
 pamir.0156.desc:0 "Today is #italic Goshnik#!, a crucial part of the Chawmos cycle, for today is the day we formally welcome children into our community, as practicing members of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] faith.\n\nBoys and girls around seven or eight years of age go through the #italic Chailaksambaik#!, where they put on traditional tunics and animals are sacrificed to them; the blood of these animals are sprinkled on the boys. Older boys, instead, go through a similar ritual called the the #italic Butsambaik#!."
 pamir.0156.desc.child:0 "\n\nAmong the children this year is my own progeny! Now, along with the other children, they all have been truly welcomed into our religion!"
 pamir.0156.a:0 "It is good to see the next generation growing up."
 pamir.0157.t:0 "Ghona Chanja"
 pamir.0157.desc:0 "Tonight is the night of #italic Ghona Chanja#!, where the god Balumain comes from [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DivineRealm] on his heavenly steed to bless us. Though he is not the chief god, he is our divine protector who taught us the proper rituals aeons ago.\n\nAt midnight, we go to a high point near the village where stands a special altar, the #italic indraine#!. There, we offer Balumain food and animal sacrifices, as the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] leads us in prayers. What shall I ask Balumain to help me with?"
 pamir.0157.a:0 "I hope Balumain blesses me too."
 pamir.0158.t:0 "Lawak Bii'rik"
 pamir.0158.desc:0 "Following #italic Ghona Chanja#!, the next ceremony is the #italic Lawak Bii’rik#!, the day of the fox. Foxes are cunning animals, who are responsible for a year’s fortunes and misfortunes. As part of this ritual, young men begin to scour the nearby hills and forests in the early morning for foxes, playing loud drums and music near the caves the foxes live in to entice them to come out. If the first fox they see runs uphill, to the pure abode of the mountains, then good fortune shall befall on all the following year; if it runs downhill, then there shall be misfortune. If no fox is found… then perhaps they were too clever for us this year."
 pamir.0158.a:0 "What does the fox say?"
 pamir.0158.toast.good:0 "The fox went uphill!"
 pamir.0158.toast.neutral:0 "No foxes were found."
 pamir.0158.toast.bad:0 "The fox went downhill!"
 pamir.0159.t:0 "The Final Dance"
 pamir.0159.desc:0 "After the search for the fox is complete, at midday, everyone returns to the village, where the final and largest celebration takes place. While there is food and dance, there is one performance that takes center stage.\n\nIn the middle of the village square, many individuals have covered their faces. Not only that, many of them, masked or not, are dressed as the opposite gender: some men are dressed as women, and some women are dressed as men. Meanwhile, the men have been divided into two groups; the “pure” men sing solemn and honored songs of the past, while the “impure” men sing obscene melodies with wild rhythms. This, truly, is the culmination of the Chawmos: when the boundaries of the realms are broken down before they are rebuilt."
 pamir.0159.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 pamir.0160.t:0 "Chawmos Ends"
 pamir.0160.desc:0 "At long last, all of the rituals of Chawmos have been properly performed, and the weeks-long celebrations come to a close. What memories we’ve all made! The new year is upon us, and let us hope it proves to be a decent one."
 pamir.0160.a:0 "Until next time."
